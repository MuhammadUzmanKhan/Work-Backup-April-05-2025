        The Evolution of Text Comparison Tools
      </h2>
      <p className="paragraph-tools-info">
        The need to compare texts has existed for as long as writing itself.
        Early on, this was a manual process, often labor-intensive and prone to
        errors.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph-tools-info">
        With the advent of computers in the mid-20th century, the first digital
        text comparison tools emerged. These early tools were basic, often
        command-line utilities designed for use by programmers and researchers.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph-tools-info">
        As personal computing advanced, text comparison tools became more
        sophisticated. Graphical user interfaces were developed, making these
        tools more accessible to non-technical users. Features like highlighting
        differences, merging changes, and supporting various file formats were
        introduced.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph-tools-info">
        Today, modern text comparison tools, like our Text Comparison Tool,
        offer a seamless and intuitive experience. Users can quickly compare
        texts, identify differences, and ensure accuracy in their documents, all
        within a user-friendly interface. These tools are invaluable in fields
        such as software development, legal, academic, and more.
