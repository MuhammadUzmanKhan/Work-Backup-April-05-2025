        The Evolution of Spinners
      </h2>
      <p className="paragraph-tools-info">
        The concept of a spinning wheel for random selection dates back
        centuries. Spinners have been used in various cultures for
        decision-making, games, and entertainment.

        In the early 20th century, board games like &quot;The Game of Life&quot;
        popularized the use of spinners as a central mechanic for gameplay.
        These physical spinners were simple yet effective tools for introducing
        an element of chance.

      <p className="paragraph-tools-info">
        With the advent of computers and digital technology, the traditional
        spinner was transformed into a virtual tool. Early digital spinners were
        basic, often used in educational software to teach probability and
        statistics.

        The rise of the internet brought interactive spinners to online
        platforms. Developers created web-based spinners for games, promotions,
        and raffles, offering a fun and engaging way to make random selections.
