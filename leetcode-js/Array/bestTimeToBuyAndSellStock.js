// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

// Example 1:

// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
// Example 2:

// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= prices.length <= 105
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let minPrice = prices[0];
  let maxProfit = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
      minPrice = prices[i];
    } else if (prices[i] - minPrice > maxProfit) {
      maxProfit = prices[i] - minPrice;
    }
  }
  return maxProfit;
};

// Explanation:

// 1.Initializes minPrice to the first element and iterates through the prices array.
// 2.It updates minPrice if a lower price is found and calculates the potential profit at each step, updating maxProfit
// if a higher profit is found.
// 3.Finally, it returns the maxProfit after iterating through all prices.
