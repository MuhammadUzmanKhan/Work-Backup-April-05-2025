// 153. Find Minimum in *******Rotated Sorted Array*******
// Solved
// Medium
// Topics
// Companies
// Hint
// Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

// [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
// [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
// Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

// Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
// Output: 11
// Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

// Constraints:

// n == nums.length
// 1 <= n <= 5000
// -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
// All the integers of nums are unique.
// nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

/**

var findMin = function (nums) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid;
    }
  }
  return nums[left];
};

// Explanation:
// Binary Search Setup:

// Initialize two pointers: left at the start of the array and right at the end of the array.
// Binary Search Execution:

// While left is less than right, calculate the mid-point mid of the current range.
// Compare the middle element with the element at the right pointer:
// If nums[mid] is greater than nums[right], it means the smallest value is
//  in the right half of the array, so move the left pointer to mid + 1.
// If nums[mid] is less than or equal to nums[right], the smallest value could be the mid element
//  or in the left half, so move the right pointer to mid.
// Final Decision:

// After the loop, the left pointer will be pointing to the minimum element in the array.
